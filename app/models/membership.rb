# In this application, all user group memberships, i.e. memberships of a certain
# user in a certain group, are stored implicitly in the dag_links table in order
# to minimize the number of database queries that are necessary to find out
# whether a user is member in a certain group through an indirect membership.
#
# This class allows abstract access to the Memberships themselves,
# and to their properties like since when the membership exists.

  # Access Methods to Associated Direct Memberships

  # Returns the direct memberships corresponding to this membership (self).
  # For clarification, consider the following structure:
  #
  #   group1
  #     |---- group2
  #             |---- user
  #
  # user is not a direct member of group1, but an indirect member. But user is a direct member of group2.
  # Thus, this method, called on a membership of user and group1 will return the membership between
  # user and group2.

  #       include( Membership.find_by( user: user, group: group2 ) )

  #     |                  |
  #     |---- group3       |
  #             |------------- user
  #
  # Here, group2 and grou3 are children of group1. user is member of group2 and group3.
  # Hence, the indirect membership of user and group1 will include both direct memberships.
