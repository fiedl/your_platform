# For some memberships, gaps need to be corrected for consistency reasons.
#
# For example, for `StatusGroup` memberships, the user is expected
# to be member of a status group of each corporation at all times.
#
# If there is a gap, then it's there by accident and needs to be corrected.
#
# Wrong:
#
#     ---no member -->|-- status 1 >|------|-- status 2 -->|----------------> time
#                                    XXXXXX
#                                    Here, the user has no status by accident.
#
# Correct:
#
#     ---no member -->|-- status 1 ------->|-- status 2 -->|----------------> time
