  # For authentication, we use devise,
  # https://github.com/plataformatec/devise.
  #
  # Available Modules:
  #   Database Authenticatable:
  #     encrypts and stores a password in the database to validate the authenticity of a user
  #     while signing in. The authentication can be done both through POST requests or
  #     HTTP Basic Authentication.
  #   Omniauthable: adds Omniauth (https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) support;
  #   Confirmable: sends emails with confirmation instructions and verifies whether an account
  #     is already confirmed during sign in.
  #   Recoverable: resets the user password and sends reset instructions.
  #   Registerable: handles signing up users through a registration process, also allowing
  #     them to edit and destroy their account.
  #   Rememberable: manages generating and clearing a token for remembering the user from a
  #     saved cookie.
  #   Trackable: tracks sign in count, timestamps and IP address.
  #   Timeoutable: expires sessions that have no activity in a specified period of time.
  #   Validatable: provides validations of email and password. It's optional and can be customized,
  #     so you're able to define your own validations.
  #   Lockable: locks an account after a specified number of failed sign-in attempts.
  #     Can unlock via email or after a specified time period.
