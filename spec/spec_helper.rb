# Factories, Stubs and Mocks
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Rspec Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RSpec.configure do |config|

  # rspec-rails 3 will no longer automatically infer an example group's
  # spec type from the file location. You can explicitly opt-in to this
  # feature using this snippet:
  #
  config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!

  # Inclusion of helper methods.
  # ......................................................................................
  #
  # The methods contained in the modules marked to be included here, will be
  # available in the spec code, without being prefixed.
  #
  # For example, including the url_helpers allows to use `url_for(some_object)`
  # in the specs.

  config.include EmailSpec::Matchers

  # TimeTravel abilities: time_travel 2.seconds
  # This can be used for caching, validity range, etc.
  #
  config.include TimeTravel

  # This introduces the method `wait_for_ajax`, which can be used when the Capybara
  # matchers do not wait properly for ajax code to be finished.
  # This is just a sleep command with a time determined by a simple benchmark.
  #
  # see spec/support/wait_for_ajax.rb
  #
  config.include WaitForAjax

  # Also, wait for the cache to invalidate.
  # This can be done with time_travel.

  # Database Wiping Policy
  # ......................................................................................

  # For each separate test, the test database is wiped. There are several ways
  # to acomplish this. But, in high level integration tests, especially when
  # using AJAX requests, there may be complications:
  #   a) Several components are hitting the database: The test code as well as
  #        the simulated browser through Capybara.
  #   b) There may be cases when asynchronous requests hit the database
  #        after passing on to the next test, when the database is wiped again
  #        already. Beware of these cases, which really produce strange errors.

  # Spec Filtering: Focus on Current Specs
  # ......................................................................................

  # By including the `focus: true` in `describe` or `it` calls in the spec code,
  # cause the test suite to focus on these blocks, i.e. run only them. This can be
  # useful if are working on a tricky one.
  #
  # BUT REMEMBER to reove the `focus: true` before comitting the spec code.
  # Otherwise you prevent other tests from being run regularly.
  #
  # config.filter_run :focus => true

  # Thus, when using `bundle exec rake`, always all specs run,
  # which is important on the server.

  # rspec-rails.

# Internationalization Settings
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Because, in tests withs :js => true, the setting from config/application.rb is used.

# Request Host
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Override the request.host to be http://example.com rather than the default
# http://www.example.com. Otherwise, each spec would first trigger the non-www redirect
# in the your_platform application controller.
