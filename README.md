YourPlatform is a [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org) engine that provides the basis for administrtive and social network platforms for closed user groups such as alumni organizations.

The application serves four main purposes: Centralized or decentralized member management, networking features for members, exchange of information and documents and communication.

## Getting Started Developing

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) including *docker-compose* on your development machine.

Then check out and start the standalone application:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fiedl/your_platform.git
cd your_platform

docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your web browser.

**Attention**: Do not use this in production on a real server as [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/fiedl/your_platform/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) includes dummy passwords!

Make sure that your docker machine has at least 8GB of RAM.

If you want to create an application based on the YourPlatform engine, please follow the [GETTING STARTED GUIDE](https://github.com/fiedl/your_platform/wiki/GettingStarted) in the wiki.
